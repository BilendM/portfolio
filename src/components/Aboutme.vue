          I’m a full-stack web developer specializing in Front-end technologies.
          I graduated from the American University of Iraq Sulaymaniyah with a
          bachelor's degree in information technology. I began with graphic
          design then found my  passion in web development. Throughout my career
          as a web developer, I've kept up with the latest technologies and
          worked hard to keep up with industry developments. I currently work as
          a web developer for Moonline Travel and Trade Ltd. I also work as a
          freelancer for a variety of clients, building full-stack websites and
          UX/UI designs.
